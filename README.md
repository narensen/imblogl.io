## What it Does üìù

This platform allows for creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts. You can organize posts using categories, assigning multiple categories to a single post. The main blog page displays recently published posts, allows filtering by category, and provides individual pages for each post.

There's also a simple admin dashboard (`/admin/posts` and `/admin/categories`) where you can manage all content, including setting posts as "Draft" or "Published" and uploading featured images.
